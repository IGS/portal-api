## Overview

* This API is built to work in conjunction with the [HMP data portal UI]( https://github.com/jmatsumura/portal-ui). 
* The API is a Flask app which uses [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) to communicate with a [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) database in order to efficiently retrieve and transfer the data in a RESTful manner.

### Video Tutorials
* [General Walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbSUBr8yWNY)
* [Facet Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mvbP9MKtvQ&feature=youtu.be)
* [Advanced Search](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDmrpYVMQwc&feature=youtu.be)
* [HMP Client](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b35UpeZ8UgM&feature=youtu.be)

### Setup
1. First, make sure all dependencies are installed and start Neo4j
2. Request an account to access [OSDF](http://osdf.igs.umaryland.edu/)
3. Use the [loader](https://github.com/jmatsumura/iHMPDCC_new_fxns/blob/master/OSDF_to_Neo4j/couchdb2neo4j_with_tags.py) to move the data from CouchDB to Neo4j
 * Make sure your Neo4j server is started and available
 * `python couchdb2neo4j_with_tags.py --db <OSDF_URL> --neo4j_password <NEO4J_PASS>`
4. Start your Flask app (must create a `conf.py` before doing this):
 * `conf.py` requires:
   * app_root - the path to the location of this repository
   * access_origin - a list of origins to accept requests from
   * be_port - the port to run this API on
   * be_loc - the IP:PORT that the API is accessible on 
   * secret_key - a complex and private string for Flask to sign sessions/cookies with
   * neo4j_ip - IP of where Neo4j is running
   * neo4j_bolt - port for Neo4j bolt connection
   * neo4j_http - port for Neo4j http connection
   * neo4j_un - username to access Neo4j database
   * neo4j_pw - password to access Neo4j database
     * An additional MySQL conf is needed under the `./lib/` directory if logins are to be supported, fill with dummy values if logging in is not required
   * mysql_h - host of the MySQL **authentication database**
   * mysql_db - name of the DB that houses the username+password rows
   * mysql_un - username to access this MySQL database
   * mysql_pw - password to access this MySQL database
     * An additional set of the same parameters but for a database which will store session/query history information
   * mysql_h_2 - host of the MySQL **session/query database**
   * mysql_db_2 - name of the DB that houses the session/query information
   * mysql_un_2 - username to access this MySQL database
   * mysql_pw_2 - password to access this MySQL database
 * Once `conf.py` is made, use the command `python app.py`
5. Can now interact with the GQL at any of the following endpoints or setup your own [portal UI]( https://github.com/jmatsumura/portal-ui)
 * `/sum_schema`
 * `/ac_schema`
 * `/files_schema`
 * `/table_schema`
 * `/indiv_files_schema`
 * `/indiv_sample_schema`

### Dependencies
* [Neo4j 3.0.0](https://neo4j.com/release-notes/neo4j-3-0-0/)
* [Python 2.7.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/)
  * [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.12/installation/)
  * [Flask-CORS](https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
  * [graphene](http://docs.graphene-python.org/en/latest/quickstart/)
  * [py2neo](http://py2neo.org/v3/)
  * [MySQL connector](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-python/en/connector-python-installation.html)

## Searching

The HMP portal offers two methods for searching the data: [facet search](https://github.com/jmatsumura/ihmp_portal_api#facet-search) and [advanced search](https://github.com/jmatsumura/ihmp_portal_api#advanced-search).

### Facet Search

`Facet Search` enables one to search for data entirely through clicking. Clicking a slice of a pie chart or a checkbox within the panel on the left will subset the data by the selected property+value combination. Additional properties can be added to subset by via the "Add a filter" option towards the top-right of the panel on the left. Selecting a new property here will add a new set of values to the panel on the left that one can interact with to filter the data by. Facet search builds by inclusion of a particular property+value combination, in order to efficiently perform an exclusive search (e.g. looking for all data **not** associated with a particular property+value combination) it is recommended to use `Advanced Search`.

### Advanced Search

`Advanced Search` is meant to be similar to how one would query a database directly. Each query requires the following general format:
```
(property) (comparison operator) (value)
```
The `property` is what you want to search on. The `comparison operator` is how you want to relate your `value` to your `property`. Your `value` is what you want to subset your `property` by. 

For example:
```
project.name = "Human Microbiome Project (HMP)"
```
The results of this query will be only those samples and files that are associated with the project name "Human Microbiome Project (HMP)". 

Try type this query in the interface and observe how auto-complete helps along the way. Auto-complete should be used for every query as it pulls directly from the database and makes sure you are searching by a valid `property`, `comparison operator`, and `value`. Thus, if you use auto-complete and find no results in your query, you know you have entered combinations of `property`+`comparison operator`+`value` which do not exist. It is also helpful to navigate through the `value`s found as this consists of all the values that currently exist in the database for that particular `property`.

### Controlled Vocabulary

The HMP portal converts the [OSDF](https://github.com/ihmpdcc/osdf-schemas) document data store of the HMP data into a graph representation. During this process certain data values are harmonized to facilitate searching. Thus, multiple OSDF values may map to a single HMP representation (e.g. both body sites 'FMA:64183' and 'stool' in OSDF become solely 'feces' in the HMP portal). Below is a table which maps the HMP portal representation of a data point to the data point(s) it originates from in OSDF.

## Cart Metadata

On the cart page of the UI, one can download both a manifest of their samples+files of interest as well as metadata for these same entities. The manifest is to be used in conjunction with the [HMP client](https://github.com/IGS/hmp_client) to efficiently download all the files. The metadata serves as an additional source of input for analysis. The metadata, which is tab-separated, will always consist of a minimum set of (in this order):
 * **sample_id**
 * **subject_id**
 * **subject_uuid**
 * **sample_body_site**
 * **visit_number**
 * **subject_gender**
 * **subject_race**
 * **study_full_name**
 * **project_name**

Additional columns may be present in the metadata file if at least one of the samples present has a non-null value for the metadata. All potential metadata which will be present, if it was collected for the sample of interest, is defined in the [OSDF](https://github.com/IGS/OSDF) schemas found below:
* [subject attributes](https://github.com/ihmpdcc/osdf-schemas/blob/master/ihmp/schemas/subject_attr.json)
* [sample attributes](https://github.com/ihmpdcc/osdf-schemas/blob/master/ihmp/schemas/sample_attr.json)
* [visit attributes](https://github.com/ihmpdcc/osdf-schemas/blob/master/ihmp/schemas/visit_attr.json)
* [attribute subsets](https://github.com/ihmpdcc/osdf-schemas/tree/master/ihmp/aux)
